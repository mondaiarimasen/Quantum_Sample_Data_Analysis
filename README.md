## Overview

Python scripts for data analysis of laser outputs. The parameters being optimized are used control lasers that measure properties of quantum computing materials. We use linear regression, hypothesis testing, correlation tests, and spectral analysis to analyze time series data from state of the art detectors.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `scipy`

You can install the required packages using pip:
